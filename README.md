Why PayPal Gift Card Generators Are Fake
PayPal’s Security is Strong – PayPal does not allow random code generation. All gift cards are created by PayPal and sold through official channels.

No Free Money Trick Exists – If someone could generate free PayPal codes, they would be rich already. These scams trick users into completing surveys, downloading malware, or giving away personal info.

Common Scam Tactics – Fake generators often:

Ask you to complete "verification" (surveys that earn scammers money)

Require downloads (which may contain viruses)

Steal your PayPal login if you enter it

Dangers of Using Fake Generators
Account Theft – Entering your PayPal details can lead to hacked accounts.

Viruses & Malware – Many "generators" contain spyware or ransomware.

Legal Risks – Trying to generate fake codes is fraud and could get you in trouble.

✔ PayPal’s Website – paypal.com/giftcards

Final Warning
There is no working PayPal gift card generator. Any website or app claiming to give free codes is a scam. Protect yourself by only buying gift cards from official sellers.
